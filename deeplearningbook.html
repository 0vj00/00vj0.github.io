Chapter 5: Machine Learning Basics

deep learning is a type of machine learning

machine learning components: model, dataset, cost function, optimization algorithm.

types of tasks handled by machine learning: 
classification
classification with missing input (e.g. model the joint probability and marginalize as necessary)
regression
transcription - converting from unstructured representation (e.g. image, audio) to text
machine translation - eng to french etc
structured output - output is a vector (or some output containing multiple values). e.g. pixel segmentation, identifying roads in images, identifying parse tree of a sentence, image captioning
anamoly detection - e.g. credit card fraud
synthesis and sampling - e.g. video game texture generation, text to audio
imputation of missing values - fill in values that are missing in a sample
denoising - compute denoised version of sample
density estimation - compute probability density of the sample space p(x)
